Hello! My name is Aeris. I'm a self-taught programmer with a basic understanding of... 
Python, C/C++, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Bash, C#, GDScript, and probably something I'm forgetting.
Basically, give me a week and a web browser and I can pick up whatever programming language you want me to.
