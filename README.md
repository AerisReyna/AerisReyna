Hello! My name is Aeris. I'm a self-taught programmer with a basic understanding of... 
Python, C/C++, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Bash, C#, GDScript, and probably something I'm forgetting.
Basically, give me a week and a web browser and I can pick up whatever programming language you want me to. My favorite is definitely Rust,
but I am really taking a liking to Python as well.

You will see several projects written in different languages. Many of these are old and I'm in the process of rewriting them in Python.
If you see commits by "ArielRayna", "Ariel", "Aurunos", "aurunos", or something similar, those are me as well. I am the sole contributor on all
repos here.

Thanks for checking out my stuff!
